== Dependency on Third-Party Services ==

This plugin relies on the integration with the **payOS** payment gateway as a third-party service to function correctly. This requires the transmission of certain data to and from the **payOS** service.

How the plugin uses **payOS**:

When an order is placed on your WooCommerce store, this plugin automatically generates a VietQR code by sending the relevant order information to the **payOS** service.
This QR code is then displayed to the customer to streamline the payment process.
